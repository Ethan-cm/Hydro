  An example sensor that reads the GPIO level defined in input-gpios. The
  purpose of this sensor is to demonstrate how to create out-of-tree drivers.

  Example definition in devicetree:

#    examplesensor {
#        compatible = "zephyr,examplesensor";
#        label = "EXAMPLESENSOR";
#        output-gpios = <&gpio 0 (GPIO_PULL_UP | GPIO_ACTIVE_LOW)>;
#    };
    
compatible: "zephyr,lcd"

include: base.yaml

properties:
  output-gpios:
    type: phandle-array
    required: true
